# brain-ai
this project aims at building an app, that uses pinecone and vectorDB to create an ai-assistent, that can get multiple documents, learn them and then write files based on that knowledge.


I wrote this part of the readme from VSCode, which I accessed via Docker Dev Environments. Does it update the repo automatically?
